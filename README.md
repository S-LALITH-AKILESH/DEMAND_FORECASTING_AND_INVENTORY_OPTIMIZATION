<h1>DEMAND FORECASTING AND INVENTORY OPTIMIZATION</h1>
<p>
  The project is able to perform demand forecasting with the help of D - Linear model.
  The xgboost model is able to perform feature extraction and provide the necessary base model for performing inventory optimization with the help of SRAMO.
  SRAMO is the reinforcement learning model that learns to decide when to order or hold stocks based on the demand for optimizaed inventory management.
